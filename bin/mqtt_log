Syntax: mqtt_log [topic_or_subtopic] outfile

mqtt_log subscribes to a topic and all its subtopics via mqtt and logs
the received messages to a given file.
It also add a timestamp to the received messages.

If mqtt_log is called from a node directory, the root topic is automatically
based on the node's main topic and the given subtopic is prefixed with it.
Also the system.node is taken into account for other MQTT settings.
To send to the node's main topic, give "" as topic.
If topic starts with / the node main topic is ignored.

If the outfile exists, the log is appended to it.
