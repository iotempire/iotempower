Syntax: mqtt_send topic_or_subtopic message

mqtt_send sends a message via mqtt.

If mqtt_send is called from a node directory, the root topic is automatically
based on the node's main topic and the given subtopic is prefixed with it.
Also the system.node is taken into account for other MQTT settings.
To send to the node's main topic, give "" as topic.
If topic starts with / the node main topic is ignored.
