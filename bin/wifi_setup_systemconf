this must be called from a node directory (or one of its parent system
directories) and reads it will set the gateway wifi configurartion of that system (SSID, password, gateway IP).

It rebuilds firmwares for the affected nodes and remotely flashes
the respected nodes.

If credentials are given, it over writes the global wifi configuration.
Else it the gateway configuration is set to the default global values

If you are running all systems from same gateway, you can also change the credentials by creating an iotempower.conf file in iot/etc/
Copy the iotempower.conf.example file, (delete the .example extension) and adjust the values.
