analog(internal_name, "external_name")
  [.with_precision(precision)]
  [.with_threshold(threshold_value, "high_word", "low_word")]
  [.with_filter(filter_function)]
  ;

Create a new analog sensor. By default it reports all value changes.
An analog value is between 0 an 1023. If precision is>1, report only changes
with a delta/difference to the last reported value with at least precision.
Setting threshold to a value from 0 to 1023 triggers sending a high_word,
when the sensor reads this threshold value or a higher value, and low_word
when reading a lower value.
A filter_function can be specified to modify and pre-process values right after
they have been read from the analog port to for example buffer some values
and build an average, median, or even implement a (fast) fourier transformation.

Parameters:
- internal_name: name of variable to create to address this device inside
  this file by other devices or helper functions.
- external_name: the name it can be addressed via MQTT in the network.
- precision: report only changes with at least this delta
- threshold: turn into digital sensor, sending high_word when threshold is 
  reached and low_word if not.
- filter_function: specify a preprocessor for measured values
  (see uhelp filter).

Example:
Assuming nodename is basement/water-sensor01.

analog(w0, "water").with_precision(10).with_threshold(100,"water","dry");

Now, a value of water is sent to "basement/water-sensor01/water", when the analog
port reads a value of more than 90 (threshold - precision). It will start
sending dry again, when it reads a value<=90, this could though be 80 due to only
updating values, when changed by amount of precision.
