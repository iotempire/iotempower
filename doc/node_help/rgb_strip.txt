rgb_strip("name", num_leds, Striptype, data_pin, 
    ...other FastLed parameters...);

Create a new rgb strip device object for an rgb-led strip connected to the
given data_pin (or data and clock_pin) with num_leds rgb leds. 
All led chips supported by FastLED (https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) are
supported.
Name will be appended to the mqtt topic.
Under the resulting topic will be the following subtopics:
- set: turn on or off
- brightness/status, brightness/set: read and set brightness (0-255)
- rgb/status, rgb/set: read and set color as colorname, 6-digit hexcode 
                       (rrggbb) or comma separated triplet (r,g,b)
                       This also takes a number to just affect one led
                       It also takes the words front and back, which will
                       push the new color into strip (from the front or the
                       back) and move all other led-colors by one

Parameters:
- internal_name: name of variable to create to address this device inside
  this file by other devices or helper functions.
- external_name: the name it can be addressed via MQTT in the network.
- data_pin: the data-pin the led strip is connected to
- num_led: number of leds on strip
- ...other FastLed parameters...: data related to chip configuration (use
  same format as in pointy brackets in FastLED.addLeds<>).

Example (node name: living room/tvlights):
rgb_strip(strip2, "rgb2", 10, WS2811, D6, BRG);

Now the second RGB LED can be switched to red via sending to the mqtt-broker
to the topic "living room/tvlights/rgb2/rgb/set" the command "2 red" or
"front red"
