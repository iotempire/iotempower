Welcome to your personal `IoTempower <https://github.com/iotempire/iotempower>`_
installation on the IoTempower gateway (short iotgateway).

If you just connected and want to dive right in, use one of these quick start
*tutorials*:

- For adding your first IoT node to your IoT system, follow
  the `First Node Tutorial </doc/first-node.rst>`_.

- After your first IoT node continue with
  the `Second Node Tutorial </doc/second-node.rst>`_.

- As you are here, you might have done this already, but for reference:
  `Pi Quickstart Tutorial </doc/quickstart-pi.rst>`_ (or check the next point).

- You also might run IoTempower yourself inside a Linux installation, 
  so you might have followed this tutorial:
  `Linux Installation </doc/installation.rst#installation-on-linux-and-wsl>`__

Here is *more documentation*:

- `Local documentation table of contents </index-doc.rst>`_

- `Command reference for nodes </doc/node_help/commands.rst>`_

- `IoTempower YouTube Playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlppUpfgGsvkfAGJ38_mzQc1-_Z7bNOgq>`_


Here are some *navigational links* that only work on the raspbery pi installation:

- `IoT system example configuration folder`_

- `Your home-directory`_

Here are links to the local *Node-RED*
(visual IoT system configuration) installation (also only on pi installation):

- `Node-RED </nodered/>`_

- `Node-RED user interface page </nodered/ui>`_
